# copy-selected-text
## Purpose of making

I used an application that had the functionality where if you select a particular text it automatically copy's it in to clipboard.
<br/>
8 out of 10 times when I select something it is for the purpose of copying 

This was made using autohotkey
and compiled to an exe
just run the exe

```
start main.exe
```
it will run in the background and will show in the hidden icon section of windows
